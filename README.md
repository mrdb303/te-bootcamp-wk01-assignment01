### Task

Build out a website using the supplied design assets and style guide.

- Implement both absolute & fixed positioning
- Utilise flexbox functionality
- Follow the supplied design notes and example
  

### Design notes, additions and changes

The white text that was used throughout was changed to a slightly darker shade. This tones down the brightness subtly. 

When hovering the mouse over the sticky top menu items, the colour of the text changes to white and stands out a little more.  

Added a timed background colour transition to white, to the 'READ MORE' buttons.

The original font used was Helvetica, which is not a font that I have a licence for. I couldn't use it on my Windows dev computer as it is not standard in Windows. I swapped it out and used the Roboto font instead, from Google fonts.

Small note added at the bottom of the footer to demonstrate the use of the `<sup>` tag on the asterisk symbol.

Implemented a JavaScript example of adding an event listener on the three 'READ MORE' buttons. When a button is clicked, the id of the button element is logged to the console. This isn't necessary, but serves as example code to demonstrate looping, const variables, assigning values from the document object model and event listeners. 

Added some subtle letter spacing to improve the design.
